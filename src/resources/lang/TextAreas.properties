#Wizard
firstTime=OR\nWould you like to update ALL your existing softmods (aka re-hack your Wii)\n\nNote: Only answer No if you know specifically what you want to update
firmware=For an instructional video on checking your firmware click Help\n\nNote: to check this, turn on your wii, click the Wii button in the bottom left of the main system menu, click Wii Settings, then you should see the firmware in the top right of the screen (ie. 4.2U, 4.1J, 3.2E, etc.)\n\nNote: If current firmware is v2.2 or under, you may need to use an alternate exploit [ie. Twilight Hack (U/E/J), Smash Stack (U/J) or Indiana Pwns (U/E)] instead of BannerBomb.
region=For an instructional video on checking your firmware click Help\n\nNote: to check this, turn on your wii, click the Wii button in the bottom left of the main system menu, click Wii Settings, then you should see the firmware in the top right of the screen (ie. 4.2U, 4.1J, 3.2E, etc.) The letter after the number shows your region, e.g 4.3U means the region is USA\n\nNote: If your Wii was region changed choose the region you are currently on
letterBomb=ATTENTION: LetterBomb is the only discless exploit for 4.3 Wii's but ModMii cannot prepare it for you yet. If you would like to use this exploit with a little bit of ModMii's help, check the box below.
upgrade=Alternatively, you can upgrade your Wii to 3.0-4.3, then repeat the Wizard using your new firmware in order to hack your Wii without requiring one of the above games.
exploit4_3pt2=The following 4.3 exploits require you to use the original disc one of the following games:
dlActiveIOSs1_4_3=You are on system menu 4.3, so you likely already have the latest IOSs. If your Wii has truly never been modified before, you can select No.
dlActiveIOSs1_modded=If you previously used ModMii (or ModMiiGui) to fully softmod your Wii, you should already have these installed.
dlActiveIOSs2=If your Wii has DarcCorp/cIOSCorp installed, you can say yes to overwrite it. If your original Wii discs or WiiWare are not working properly, say yes to fix it.
upDowngrade=Note: If the current firmware = new firmware, a system menu is not downloaded.
letterBombInstr=ModMiiGui will open your browser to a page showing an instructional video on properly downloading Letterbomb. On this webpage, enter your System Menu region and MAC address\n\nNote: to find your Wii's MAC address, turn on your Wii, click the Wii button in the bottom left of the main system menu, then click Wii Settings, then Internet, then Console Information.\n\nUncheck Bundle the HackMii Installer for Me, fill in the captcha and cut either wire. It will download a small ZIP file. Open this file, and you will see a private folder, copy and paste it into the root of the sd card.\n\nModMii will generate a guide for you assuming you've done this correctly.\n\nPress Next to open up the web page and continue.
usbLoaderToo=Notes:\n- A USB-Loader allows the Wii to play games off an external Hard Drive.\n- This step can always be done by itself later on from ModMiiGui's Main Menu.
#USB-Loader
fat=Pros: The Wii can access apps, games, covers and music stored on FAT32. Ideal if you don't always have an SD card to launch the USB-Loader. Compatible with SNEEK/Triiforce Nand Emulation.\n\nCons: Cannot store files greater than 4GBs. The limit does not apply to Wii games, which can be split into parts. This will likely not affect you unless the drive is also used to store high-def videos
ntfs=Pros: Capable of storing files greater than 4GB. CFG USB-Loader can access games, covers and music stored on NTFS\n\nCons: The Wii cannot access apps stored on NTFS, so an SD card is required to run the USB-Loader (or a SM Channel). Incompatible with SNEEK/Triiforce Nand Emulation.
fatAndNtfs=Note: Small flash drives cannot be partitioned\n\nPros: You can access Wii apps on the FAT32 partition while still being able to save files greater than 4GBs on the NTFS partition\n\nCons: A little more work to setup than the other option
wbfs=Cons: WBFS can ONLY be read by the Wii and ONLY used to store Wii Games
usb=Pros: SD-Card not required to launch USB-Loader. USB-Loader files take up a small % of USB hard drive free space\n\nCons: Slightly slower loading time (almost negligible)
sd=Pros: Slightly faster loading time (almost negligible)\n\nCons: USB-Loader files can take up a large % of SD card free space
#SNEEK
sneek=Requirements:\n\n- Your Wii must have BootMii installed in order to run SNEEK. If you don't have it installed, run ModMii's Download Wizard.\n- To optimize the speed of your SNEEK or SNEEK+DI emulated nand, your SD card should be formatted using 32KB sector sizes.\n- UNEEK and UNEEK+DI require the External Hard Drive be formatted as FAT32 using cluster sizes 32KB or lower. If you don't know how to format your drive this way, run ModMii's USB-Loader Setup.\n- SNEEK+DI and UNEEK+DI always uses the 1st partition if multiple are found.\n\nWARNING: SNEEK is not directly supported by ModMii.\nAny problems you have with SNEEK that are not a direct result of ModMii should be reported here: tinyurl.com/neeek2o\nThis is also a great place to learn more about SNEEK in general. Another great resource is the guide here: tinyurl.com/SNEEK-DI
