firstTime=Is this your first time softmodding your Wii?\nOR\nWould you like to update ALL your existing softmods (aka re-hack your Wii)\n\nNote: Only answer No if you know specifically what you want to update
firmware=What is your current firmware version?\n\nFor an instructional video on checking your firmware click Help\n\nNote: to check this, turn on your wii, click the Wii button in the bottom left of the main system menu, click Wii Settings, then you should see the firmware in the top right of the screen (ie. 4.2U, 4.1J, 3.2E, etc.)\n\nNote: If current firmware is v2.2 or under, you may need to use an alternate exploit [ie. Twilight Hack (U/E/J), Smash Stack (U/J) or Indiana Pwns (U/E)] instead of BannerBomb.
